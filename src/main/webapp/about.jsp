I have been at Google for a year and a half and recently graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2016 with a double major in Math and Computer Science. I grew up in Mountain View and moved back here after college- safe to say I'm ready to move somewhere new! I love the usual bay area things- hiking, skiing, and avocado toast. I have been a vegetarian my whole life but just last week I tried salmon for the first time.. I have definitely been missing out. My passion outside of work that I would like to explore more is the intersection of education, business, and technology.";

I actually came as a Business Administration major and then discovered coding, which was a major shift in my life and so far the best one. I really want to find a way to combine and implement both business and technology in my life. More on bio, I was born in Mongolia, but grew up in Ukraine, then moved back to Mongolia. I did a study abroad program in middle school in Japan, where I found that I want to travel more and learn about different cultures. I also love dogs, the big ones. I think small dogs look like toys!";

I have always loved entrepreneurship and the intersection of business and technology. I worked at GE Digital last summer where I began to get a glimpse of working on software within a team, and the surprising challenges associated with collaboration. Outside of schoolwork, I am involved with a consulting club on campus and enjoy dancing and basketball in my free time.";

I was born and raised in Busan, South Korea, which is a beach town with lots of fresh seafood! I love seafood, especially sushi! I have been dancing for K-pop since middle school and I have recently started to post cover videos on Instagram and Youtube. I also love animals! Lastly, I am very interested in equal access to education and feminism!!";

I grew up in Tainan, Taiwan and it has the best food in the world. In my free time I enjoy going to hackathons, building cool projects, and experimenting with new technology. I love cats and big dogs and I dream of having a Alaskan malamute and three cats as pets, assuming the dog does not eat/attack the cats.";
